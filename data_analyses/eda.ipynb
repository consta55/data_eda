       "[array(['•  Your glucose levels were in normal reference range and healthy at the time of your test.\\n•  Your hemoglobin A1c percentage was in normal reference range and healthy. Hemoglobin A1c measures your average blood sugar over the last three months. A hemoglobin A1c result of 6.5% or higher is diagnostic for diabetes. If your Hemoglobin A1c falls within the range of 5.7% to 6.4%, it suggests that you have prediabetes. Your hemoglobin A1c percentage was below both diabetic and prediabetic ranges and considered optimal.\\n•  Your insulin levels were in normal reference range but a little higher than optimal. This suggests that your pancreas is working harder to process the amount of sugar that you are eating. Over time, your pancreas can get less effective at this, which can lead to insulin resistance, elevated sugars, and diabetes. This can be controlled by watching the amount of sugar in your diet. It is beneficial to continue monitoring these levels over time, especially if any changes occur in your health status. Speaking to you doctor about this will help better understand this result within the context of your overall health picture.\\n•  Your triglycerides were well below the upper limit threshold of 150 mg/dL and considered healthy.\\n•  Your other metabolic tests were normal.\\n',\n",
       "        '•  Your total cholesterol levels were within normal reference range and healthy.\\n•  Your LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were in normal reference range falling below 100 mg/dL. This is considered optimal and heart healthy.\\n•  Your HDL, the “good” cholesterol, was high and cardioprotective.\\n•  Your inflammatory marker High-Sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were greater than 3 mg/L and considered elevated. This correlates with an elevated risk for heart disease.\\n•  Your Omega 3 fatty acid RISK index was high. An Omega 3 fatty acid risk index that is less than 2.2% correlates with a high risk for heart disease. This can be improved by increasing your Omega 3 fatty acid intake. See the \"nutrients\" section for more information regarding this result.\\n•  You have a mix of both negative and protective factors. Overall, the cholesterol levels were not concerning but still should be monitored. It is important to focus on a heart-healthy diet, incorporating more fiber, lean proteins, and healthy fats while reducing sugars and refined carbohydrates, coupled with regular exercise to improve these lipid parameters and reduce cardiovascular risk. Also, it is still in your best interest to discuss these findings with your primary care doctor for a comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment.\\n',\n",
       "        '•  Your inflammatory marker High-Sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were elevated above 3 mg/L. Levels greater than 3 mg/L could indicate an infection or an acute/chronic inflammatory process occurring. If you have suspected inflammation after discussion with your primary care doctor, please have this rechecked.\\n•  Your eosinophil count was high. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that play a role in the immune response, particularly in combating parasitic infections and certain allergic reactions. High levels of eosinophils can also be caused by autoimmune diseases, asthma, certain medications, and other skin/blood disorders. Prolonged periods of high eosinophils can lead to inflammation as well. Generally speaking, a one-time occurrence of high eosinophils is not concerning but if you are having allergy symptoms or trouble breathing, please discuss this with your regular doctor to determine if further evaluation is needed.\\n•  Your other inflammatory markers / immune regulation tests were normal.\\n',\n",
       "        '•  Your liver enzyme panel indicates that all of your results were within the reference ranges, which suggests that your liver function is normal. Total protein, albumin, and globulin levels were also within healthy ranges, suggesting adequate liver synthetic function and no signs of abnormal liver metabolism. Moreover, an optimal Albumin/Globulin Ratio reflects good liver and kidney health, and normal levels of bilirubin show that your liver is effectively clearing this substance from your blood. Lastly, the Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), Aspartate Transaminase (AST), and Alanine Transaminase (ALT) fall comfortably within the normal ranges, indicating no cellular damage to your liver. It is beneficial to continue monitoring these levels over time, especially if any changes occur in your health status.',\n",
       "        '•  There was no sign of kidney dysfunction or disease based on blood testing. Your Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, which are waste products filtered by the kidneys, were within optimal limits. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was above 60, suggesting the kidneys are filtering blood at an acceptable rate for age. Regular check-ups with your health care provider and maintaining a heart-healthy diet, hydration, and physical activity level are strongly advised to support ongoing kidney and overall health.\\n\\n',\n",
       "        '•  Leukocyte Esterase and bacteria was detected in your urine. Your white blood cell count (WBC) in the urine was a little elevated as well. Leukocyte Esterase is an enzyme released by leukocytes (type of white blood cell) used as an indicator for the possibility of inflammation in the urinary tract. A positive Leukocyte esterase (enzyme), presence of bacteria, and elevated white blood cell count all could be a sign of a urinary tract infection. If you are experiencing fever or urinary symptoms such as burning, frequency, discharge, discomfort, please let your doctor know ASAP.\\n•  Squamous epithelial cells were found in your urine. Most of the time it means that your urine sample was contaminated. However, if it was not contaminated it could also indicate urinary tract infection (UTI), yeast infection, kidney disease, liver disease, and other potential conditions that should be evaluated and determined by your doctor.\\n•  Calcium oxalate crystals were present in your urine. Calcium oxalate crystals are a common type of crystal that can form in urine and are often associated with kidney stones. However, the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in the urine does not necessarily mean that kidney stones are present. In some cases, the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in the urine can be an indication of an underlying medical condition, metabolic disorder. However, in other cases, it may simply be due to dietary factors such as a high intake of oxalate-rich foods like spinach or rhubarb.\\n•  Your other urine tests were all normal.\\n',\n",

       "'[\\'•  Your iron studies were normal.\\\\n•  There were no signs of B12 deficiency and your homocysteine was normal, but a little higher than optimal. At much higher levels, this can lead to an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. It can also be a sign of decreased methylation capacity. Methylation is a process used by the body to detoxify and turn on and off genes. Typically, this is caused by a nutrient deficiency. Your b12 levels were normal, but there can be folate or b6 deficiency associated with this. We didn’t specifically check for these. Please discuss this with your regular doctor.\\\\n•  Your vitamin D levels were low. Vitamin D is important for healthy bones and many other functions in the body. This can be due lack of adequate sunshine and can be supplemented. Please discuss this with your doctor.\\\\n•  Your other minerals tested were normal.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOmegaCheck® - Omega Fatty Acid Analysis\\\\nPlease go over this information first to help understand your individual omega fatty acid commentary below the dashed line:\\\\n- Arachidonic Acid (AA) = Omega 6 fatty acid = Pro-inflammatory (Bad) - \\\\n- Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) & Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) = Omega 3 fatty acid = Anti-inflammatory (Good) -\\\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n•  Your Omega 3 risk index was high. This means that your Omega 3 levels correlate with a high risk for heart disease as stated in your heart health section. Increasing your Omega 3 fatty acids (EPA & DHA) would be beneficial to reduce cardiovascular risk. Please discuss this finding with your doctor before making any dietary adjustments.\\\\n\\'\\n \\'•  Regarding fertility, your AMH level suggests a low ovarian reserve, which is normal for your age.\\\\n•  Your sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) was a little elevated. This is a protein that binds and patrols the amount of sex hormones your body can use and can affect sexual function and fertility. Please discuss this with your doctor\\\\n•  All your other sex related hormones tested appear healthy for a female your age.\\\\n\\'\\n \\'•  Your liver function was normal.\\'\\n \\'•  There was no sign of kidney dysfunction or disease based on blood testing.\\'\\n \\'•  Your sugars looked good (both fasting and average).\\\\n•  Your other metabolic tests were normal.\\\\n\\'\\n \\'•  Leukocyte Esterase was detected in your urine. Leukocyte Esterase is an enzyme released by white blood cells (WBCs) used as an indicator for the possibility of inflammation in the urinary tract. A positive Leukocyte esterase (enzyme) could be a sign of a urinary tract infection, but could also be due to a poor sample, especially if they did not provide you with a wipe. If you are experiencing fever or urinary symptoms such as burning, frequency, discharge, discomfort, please let your doctor know ASAP.\\\\n•  Your other urine tests were all normal.\\\\n\\'\\n \\'•  Your Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA) screening test was positive at a borderline low level. This test checks for autoimmunity. However, it is often positive without any clinical significance.\\\\n•  There were no signs of Celiac disease based on blood testing. You must have eaten some gluten in the last 2-4 weeks before the test for this to be accurate.\\\\n•  Your other autoimmune tests were normal. However, there are many other autoimmune diseases that we did not check for specifically.\\\\n\\'\\n \\'•  All your electrolytes were normal.\\'\\n \\'•  Your blood ABO group is Type B.\\\\n•  Your blood tests did not indicate the presence of anemia.\\\\n\\'\\n \\'•  Your cholesterol was elevated. This can be related to both diet and/or genetics.\\\\n•  The small dense \"bad\" LDL cholesterol was elevated, which increases risk for heart disease.\\\\n•  Your total HDL, the “good” cholesterol was high which is protective. However, your Large HDL particles were less than optimal which may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, even if the total HDL level is normal.\\\\n•  Also, your ApoB was a little elevated. Apolipoprotein B attaches to negative types of cholesterol that cause plaque buildup in your blood vessels, which can lead to damage and heart disease.\\\\n•  Your inflammatory marker High-Sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was less than 1 mg/L. This correlates with a low risk for heart disease.\\\\n•  Your Omega 3 fatty acid levels correlate with high risk for heart disease. This can be improved by increasing your Omega 3 fatty acid intake. See \"nutrients\" section for more information regarding this.\\\\n•  You have a mix of both negative and protective factors, but overall, the negative factors could put you at risk for heart disease or vascular disease in the long term. This usually can be managed with diet changes, supplements and/or medication. Please discuss these findings with your regular doctor.\\\\n\\'\\n \\'•  Your pancreatic (digestive) enzymes were normal.\\'\\n \\'•  Your thyroid function looked optimal, there were no signs of autoimmune thyroid problems/Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.\\'\\n \\'•  There were no signs of significant heavy metal exposure.\\'\\n \\'Overall, you likely have some risk factors that involve diet, exercise, and lifestyle that if addressed can help optimize your health and reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, bone disease, and potential of diabetic progression in the future. \\\\nYou had a few abnormal findings:\\\\n•\\\\tAntinuclear Antibodies (ANA) Screen\\\\n•\\\\tSex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)\\\\n•\\\\tTotal Cholesterol\\\\n•\\\\tLDL-Cholesterol\\\\n•\\\\tLDL Small\\\\n•\\\\tLDL Medium\\\\n•\\\\tLDL Particle Number\\\\n•\\\\tLDL Peak Size\\\\n•\\\\tHDL Large\\\\n•\\\\tNon-HDL Cholesterol\\\\n•\\\\tApolipoprotein B (ApoB)\\\\n•\\\\tOmega-3 Index Risk\\\\n•\\\\tVitamin D\\\\n•\\\\tLeukocyte - Urine\\\\nLabs should be addressed with your primary care doctor and rechecked if necessary. \\\\nPlease discuss these results with your regular doctor If you have any questions or concerns as well. \\\\nThank you again for choosing Function Health. We wish you the best on your functional health journey! \\\\n\\\\n-Billiken Lin, MD\\\\n\\'\\n \\'•  Your adrenals/stress hormones looked healthy.\\'\\n \\'•  Your inflammatory markers / immune regulation tests were normal.\\']'"
